## How does it work?
- DC Motors
- H-bridge
- STM32 (timers, PWM, GPIO)
- CubeIDE

## STM32 configurations

To connect the DC motor to your microcontroller, follow these steps:

1. Identify the motor terminals: Most DC motors have two terminals, labeled as positive (+) and negative (-).
2. Connect the positive terminal of the motor to a digital output pin on your microcontroller.
3. Connect the negative terminal of the motor to the ground (GND) pin on your microcontroller.
4. Make sure to provide sufficient power to the motor. Check the motor's datasheet for the recommended voltage and current ratings.

## To-Do List for Enhancement

- Add more examples for different motor control techniques (e.g., speed control, direction control).
- Include troubleshooting tips for common issues.
- Provide a detailed explanation of the motor's specifications and limitations.
- Add a section on advanced motor control algorithms.
