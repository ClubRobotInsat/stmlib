## How does it work?
- DC Motors
- H-bridge
- STM32 (timers, PWM, GPIO)
- CubeIDE

## Connections

To connect the DC motor to your microcontroller, you will need a H-bridge for interface. The circuit a as follow:

[insert circuit]

## STM32 configuration



## Code Example

```C

```

## To-Do List for Enhancement

- Add more examples for different motor control techniques (e.g., speed control, direction control).
- Include troubleshooting tips for common issues.
- Provide a detailed explanation of the motor's specifications and limitations.
- Add a section on advanced motor control algorithms.
